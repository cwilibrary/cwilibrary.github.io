<h3 id="understanding-urls">Understanding URLs</h3>

<p>All resources require evaluation, but some URLs make a researcher's job a little easier. The lists below show URLs in the order from those that require the least amount of evaluation to the most evaluation.</p>

<ol>
  <li>.edu</li>
    <ol>
      <li>What is it? An .edu website is a page from a college or university website.</li>
      <li>Should I use it? Most .edu websites are considered reliable for research, but privately-owned pages from faculty or students can contain inaccurate information. These personal pages on .edu sites usually have a ~ symbol somewhere in the web address.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>.gov and .mil</li>
    <ol>
      <li>What are they? Websites ending in .gov are pages from U.S. federal, state, or local governments, including government agencies; .mil websites contain information from the U.S. military.</li>
      <li>Should I use them? Websites that end with .gov and .mil are generally acceptable for academic research papers. You will want to check how reports are vetted. You can also look up the page on Wikipedia to see if any notable changes have been made, or look at the page's history yourself if there are prior versions available on the <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org</a> site.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>.org</li>
    <ol>
      <li>What are they? Websites ending in .org are organization websites. Initially this was intended for member organizations or nonprofits, but now anyone can get a website that ends in .org.</li>
      <li>Should I use it? Analyze .org sites carefully. Many are biased toward a specific agenda they're pushing,a nd sometimes for-profit groups have a .org address. As with .com sites, basic contact information or mission/vision statements should be okay to use.</li>
    </ol>
  <li>.com</li>
    <ol>
      <li>What is it? A .com signals a commercial website. It's become the default for websites. Reputable news sites end in .com. They often sell subscriptions or advertisements, but those sales don't influence the information in their reporting.</li>
      <li>Should I use it? Most .com websites should be used with caution beyond basic information, i.e. the website maker's contact info, mission/vision statements, etc. But library databases and journalistic content with a peer review process are .com. Remember to check the about page and Wikipedia for credibility.</li>
